            <h3>What Is Cosplay?</h3>
            <p>Cosplay (コスプレ kosupure), a contraction of the words costume play, Is a hobby in which participants called
                cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character Cosplayers often
                interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed
                role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may
                be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include anime,
                cartoons, comic books, live-action films, television series and video games. </p>
            <p> The rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990s has made the phenomenon a
                significant aspect of popular culture in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western world.
                Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions and there are also dedicated conventions and local
                and international competitions, as well as social networks, websites and other forms of media centered
                on cosplay activities.</p>
            <p>The term "cosplay" was coined in Japan in 1984. It was inspired by and grew out of the practice
                then-known as fan costuming at science fiction conventions, beginning with the 1st World Science Fiction
                Convention in New York City in 1939.</p>

        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>In 1984, Nobuyuki Takahashi, founder of Studio Hard, attended the 42nd Worldcon in Los Angeles. He was
            impressed with the masquerade and reported on it in My Anime, coining the term kosupure (from which cosplay
            is derived) in the process. His report also encouraged Japanese fans to include more costuming in their own
            conventions. The initial report also used the terms "costume play" (コスチュームプレイ kosuchuumu purei) and the
            English "Hero Costume Operation" but kosupure was the term that caught on.</p>
        <p>As stated above, costuming had been a fan activity in Japan from the 1970s, and it became much more popular
            in the wake of Takahashi's report. The new term did not catch on immediately, however. It was a year or two
            after the article was published before it was in common use among fans at conventions. It was in the 1990s,
            after exposure on television and in magazines, that the term and practice of cosplaying became common
            knowledge in Japan. </p>
        <p>The first cosplay cafés appeared in the Akihabara area of Tokyo in the late 1990s. A temporary maid café was
            set up at the Tokyo Character Collection event in August 1998 to promote the video game Welcome to Pia
            Carrot 2 (1997). An occasional Pia Carrot Restaurant was held at the shop Gamers in Akihabara in the years
            up to 2000. Being linked to specific intellectual properties limited the lifespan of these cafés, which was
            solved by using generic maids, leading to the first permanent establishment, Cure Maid Café, which opened in
            March 2001. </p>
        <p>The first World Cosplay Summit was held on October 12, 2003 at the Rose Court Hotel in Nagoya, Japan, with
            five cosplayers invited from Germany, France and Italy. There was no contest until 2005, when the World
            Cosplay Championship began. The first winners were the Italian team of Giorgia Vecchini, Francesca Dani and
            Emilia Fata Livia.
            Worldcon masquerade attendance peaked in the 1980s and started to fall thereafter. This trend was reversed
            when the concept of cosplay was re-imported from Japan. </p>
